# Statistics Calculator Project

## Project Completion Overview
This project implements a statistics calculator that computes several key statistical measures from a dataset provided via a file input. The implemented statistics include:

- Average
- Median
- Variance
- Standard Deviation

The program reads data from a file specified as a command-line argument, calculates these statistics, and outputs the results in a formatted manner.

## What I Accomplished
- Implemented a Go program that reads numerical data from a file and performs statistical calculations.
- Successfully computed and printed the average, median, variance, and standard deviation of the dataset.
- Handled file input/output operations and command-line argument parsing effectively.

## Learning Outcomes
Through completing this project, I gained valuable insights into several areas:

- **Statistical Concepts:** I deepened my understanding of fundamental statistical measures such as average, median, variance, and standard deviation.
  
- **File Handling:** I learned how to read data from a file and process it programmatically in Go, ensuring efficient handling of potentially large datasets.
  
- **Error Handling:** I implemented robust error handling mechanisms, ensuring the program behaves gracefully when encountering unexpected input or file-related issues.
  
- **Testing and Validation:** I became adept at testing my implementation against various datasets, verifying the accuracy of statistical calculations through comparison with expected results.
  
- **Documentation:** I practiced writing clear and informative documentation (like this README.md file) to guide users on how to use the program and understand its output.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional statistical measures or options for different types of input datasets (e.g., handling non-integer data or supporting different file formats).
- Improve efficiency and performance optimizations for handling large datasets or specific edge cases.

## Running the Program
To run the program, use the following command format:
```cmd
$ go run main.go data.txt
```
## Conclusion
This project was a great opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge of statistics in a practical programming context. It provided hands-on experience with data manipulation, file handling, and algorithmic implementation of statistical formulas. Moving forward, I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and continuing to explore more advanced topics in statistics and software development.
